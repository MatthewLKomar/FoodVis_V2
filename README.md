This is a virtual reality data visualization where the user is sorrounded by an interactive Parallel Coordinate. This was made with love in Unreal Engine 4 for CMU's 05-499 Data Visualization Class. 

To run this locally, clone this repository onto your PC, install the latest version of Unreal Engine, Oculus and go to best buy and buy yourself an Oculus Quest and a decently long USB Type C link cable. 

After you've paired your Quest to your computer, launch Unreal Engine. 

Then go into ``Content>MatthewWorld`` and click the arrow pointing down near the play button on the top of the editor. Click ``Play in Virtual Reality``. Put on your headset and use the controllers. 

- To scale vertically, press the top buttons on your Oculus Controllers (Y and B), the grip and trigger buttons and mvoe your hands in opposite directions from eachother up and down. 

- To scale horizontally, press the top buttons on your Oculus Controllers (Y and B), the grip and trigger buttons and mvoe your hands in opposite directions from eachother left and right. 

- To filter, click the icon on your left wrist and a menu will appear above it. You can grab the menu and move it to where ever you like. Tap the buttons and filtration will occur! 

- To select individual points, go up to a point and literally point at it and press the trigger. It is now selected and the display shows up.
